"In the realm of bits and bytes we stand,
In the IM class, a digital band.
Thirteen boys with minds so keen,
Navigating screens, a tech dream.

In this code symphony, we find our groove,
With keyboards clacking, a rhythm to prove.
FAQs swirling like data streams,
In the IT world, where logic gleams.

"Tell us, teacher, the secret of code?"
They asked, as the circuits hummed and flowed.
Tips were shared, knowledge sown,
In the garden of algorithms, we've grown.

Binary whispers, ones and zeroes,
As the IM class, the knowledge bestows.
A tech ballet, where bugs are guests,
In the language of machines, we are the jesters.

"Fear not the errors, they're but a clue,
To debug the puzzle, the coder's true brew."
A tip from the sage of silicon halls,
In the IM class, where logic calls.

So here we are, a brotherhood of code,
In the IM class, where talents strode.
Thirteen boys in a tech ballet,
In the language of the future, we sway." - chatGPT
